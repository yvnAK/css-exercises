Didn't interpret the HTML properly. 
Thought I would either have to apply the styling to the '.box' or '.container .box' to get specific to the item itself. 
Flex is a system for organising the things inside a container, and so the styling (which I got right thanks to W3Schools) is actually supposed to be in '.container'.
