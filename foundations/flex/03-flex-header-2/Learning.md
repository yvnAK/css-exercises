# Heading
padding was given as 16px instead of 8. <br>
display flex was necessary, content justification was correct, and adjusting the padding was also the right decison.

# Unordered list
margin and padding should be 0. instead, padding was put as 8px on both sides and no margin was adjusted. <br>
display flex, padding, and gap was the right decision

# Left and right
They made their lefts and rights as classes where I made them as id's. They didn't have a item justification, and instead put a gap of 16px <br>
Should have combined the left and right id's for the same styling, but splitting them was the right decision in the html and in the css. display flex was the right choice, as well as item aligning
