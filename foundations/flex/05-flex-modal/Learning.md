# Outcome
Looks the same as the desired outcome

# Differences
Close button put inside the header div with the "are you sure you want to do that" writing
Weird syntax, but its basically like having a header div and putting the message in there and the button in there.
Something like this: <br>
.<.d.iv> <br>
    Are you sure <br>
    .<b.utton>x</but.ton> <br>
.<./d.iv> <br>

.header has display flex, align items centerm font weight 700 instead of just bold, and bargin bottom 8px.
<br> they also didnt touch the buttons for some reason
<br> their heading is slightly lower than mine

# Similarities
Put everything other than the icon in its own container. <br>
display flex, gap, and padding are all correct in .modal <br>
flex shrink 0 on icon <br>
font weight bold, font size 18px and justify content (but space around instead of space between)

<br>
.text margin bottom is 16px
