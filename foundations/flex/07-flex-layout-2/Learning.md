# HTML
Body instead of container which contains sidebar and cards. <br>
The html structure is basically the same.

# CSS
## body
display flex
flex direction column

## header
display flex
padding left 16 (they added extra padding on the right side)
font weight and size correct

## footer
display flex
align items center
justify content center

## li
missing margin bottom 16
extra list style none

## a
text colour white and no text decoration
missing font size 24px, and its on .sidebar instead

## cards in style.css, container in solution.css
display flex correct, but added flex direction without adding wrap. also needs 32px gap

## sidebar
have flex shrink and padding, but extra font size 24px.

## card
padding should be 16 instead of 12, and width should be 300px instead of 240

## container in solution, cards in style
padding and flex and wrap correct, but gap 32px not included and flex 1 is incorrect.
