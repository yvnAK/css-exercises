# Odd Numbers
Instead of making an odd-number class, I just copied and pasted stuff. For number 3, I should have chained specifiers

# Overall
They had '.odd', an '.adjust-font-size' thing too for number 3 and 4, and a '#two'
On the HTML, 3 had the style: 'class ="odd adjust-font-size""', and 4 had the styling 'id="four" class="adjust-font-size"'
